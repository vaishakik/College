									<h2>historical monuments of india</h2>
									<p>        tell us our culture and tradition </p>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>India is rich in culture,traditions,heritage buildings, temples, forts and palaces. Famous Indian Monuments includes Old Churches of Goa ,The Taj Mahal, Qutab Minar of Delhi, Charminar, Red fort and Jantar mantar, these are also few most visited Heritage Sites in India.
								These Historical Monuments are the only wealth of Indian tourism along with other World Heritage Sites and 
								Nature tourism places like wild parks and ancient temples of south India</p>
								<p>Historical Monuments can be classified according to architecture styles, religious entities, period
of construction etc. By period we mean the monuments constructed can be differentiated as per their time e.g. Indus valley
period, Magadha Empire, Gupta Empire etc in Ancient India, Mughal period during Medieval India and monuments of Modern
India. Styles of Architecture also plays a vital role in classification of Historical Places of India. For example the monuments
built during Mughal era are classical examples of Turkish-Persian architecture, while the monuments of South India gives the
glimpses of Dravidian Architecture.</p>

										<h2>Belur Chennakeshava Temple </h2>
										<p>maecenas feugiat ex purus, quis volutpat lacus placerat</p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p> The Chennakesava Temple, originally called Vijayanarayana Temple, was built on the banks of the Yagachi River in Belur,
									by the Hoysala Empire King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 AD. Chennakesava means “handsome Kesava”. Lord Vishnu is worshipped in this temple.
									These temple complexes have been proposed to be listed under UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
                                     If one is willing to spend enough time at Belur,
									 there is no end to the pleasures one experiences in gazing at the different mythological tales that these time-tested monuments have to narrate. 
									 The temples create magic during the early hours of the day, just before sunrise, when a tranquil atmosphere surrounds them.
									 This is the best time to enjoy and understand the poetry of these stone images. 
									 The transition from dawn to after sunrise is also something not to be missed. 
									 Suddenly the temple brightens up bringing with it the liveliness of the local devotees, who begin to throng in, as part of a daily ritual. 
									 A total different mood sets in, that of colour and light.
